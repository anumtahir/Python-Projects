The given dataset contains about 567,000 incident reports of crimes in Boston, USA starting from 2015 to 2022. Crime incident reports are provided by Boston Police Department (BPD) to document the initial details surrounding an incident to which BPD officers respond. This is a dataset containing records from the new crime incident report system, which includes a reduced set of fields focused on capturing the type of incident as well as when and where it occurred. Records in the new system begin in June of 2015. The description of the project is given in "Project description.pdf".
